### RoomUtils
RoomUtils allows you to easily grab information about the room, such as player count, an array of players and the room code.
Example:

```cs
    UnityEngine.Debug.Log(HoneyLib.Utils.RoomUtils.RoomUtils.RoomCode);
```

The result of this snippet would be the room code being logged out, so if the code is `HX7G`, it will log `HX7G`.
